    "At the simplest level every network in the brain is made of either inhibitory neurons or both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In the neocortex most networks are composed of 70-80% excitatory neurons and 20-30 inhibitory neurons. Of course these neurons can be classified further in different categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we think of a network, we need to define the connectivity between nodes (here neurons). Experimental data suggests that in the neocortex average connection probabilty measured over 100$\\mu$m of distance is sparse (about 10%). And at this scale neurons are more or less randomly connected. However, if we go beyond 100$\\mu$m the connection probability start to decay as a function of distance between neurons. And beyond 1cm spatial distance connectivity has very different rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "In this tutorial we will consider one of the simplest model of the neocortical tissue. We will assume that \n",
    "- The network is composed of one type of excitatory and one type of inhibitory neurons\n",
    "- There are 80% excitatory neurons and 20% inhibitory neurons\n",
    "- All neurons have identical properties and are  modelled as integrate-fire-neurons\n",
    "- Neurons are connected in a random fashion with 10% connection probability\n",
    "- All the synapses are current-based and synaptic integration is linear\n",
    "- Neurons are driven by Poisson type spike trains\n",

    "## You might wonder what can we learn from such a simple model? \n",
    "This model is sufficient to understand the emergence of synchonization, oscillation and stability of network activity dynamics. Synchrony and oscillations are ubiqutious properties of brain activity and play important role in encoding and transfer of information in the brain. Moreover, a number of brain diseases are manifested in terms of changes in synchrony and oscillations. For instance. Parkinson's disease is a diseases of increased oscillations. \n",

    "#### If there are synchronous spikes then a lot of neurons will spike together and go into refractoriness together. That means that synchronization will result in higher than expected variance of the population average. That is, we can estimate the variance of the population activity. However, when we have a Poisson process which by definition is an uncorrelated (not synchronized) population activity variance increases with population activity mean. That is, if firing rate increase we expected higher variance. So we need to normalize the popultion variance by its mean. The ratio variance/mean is called *Fano  Factor* and it is 'one' for a Poisson process. Here we are binning the data so Fano Factor does depend on the bin size. Nevertheless it is a very good measure of syhchrony."
